    "description": "Hy, my name is Claude Davis and this is my 432 pages, color, hardcover.

The Lost Ways prepares you to deal with worst-case scenarios with the minimum amount of resources just like our forefathers lived their lives, totally independent from electricity, cars, or modern technology whatsoever, which means you'll also be bulletproof against the ever-increasing threat of an Electro Magnetic Pulse, a Powerful Economic Breakdown, Famines, and Natural Disasters.",

    "description": "\u2192 319 color pages, 400 wild foods, plant localization maps for each plant (400 maps), paperback, great print quality, superior plant identification guidelines, recipes for each plant, full page photos of the plants, at least 3 pictures for each plant, medicinal uses.\n\n\n\n The Forager\u2019s Guide to Wild Foods is probably the most important thing you want to have by your side when you go out foraging. Maybe there are times when you're still not sure about a certain plant and you need to consult the book, despite your vast experience. Or maybe you don\u2019t have experience at all and just want to find wild goodies using the book. \n\n\n\n This book is the ultimate resource for every home, kept right next to your emergency foods, in your Bug out Bag, on your coffee table, or in your bookcase. You can use this book to put food on your table in case hard times are coming ahead. This knowledge is better at your fingertips now, as you might not be able to get it when you need it the most. \n\n\n\n You can also use the book to make your own remedies from plants growing around you. Inside The Forager\u2019s Guide to Wild Foods there are hundreds of medicinal plants and detailed, super simple instructions on how to take advantage of them.\n\n\n\n A lot of high-priced foods you find labeled as ORGANIC, are nothing compared to the ones that grow in the wild. Wild foods mean no GMO, no pesticides, herbicides or harmful contaminants. There are no foods healthier than the ones you pick yourself in the wild.  \n\n\n\n This is FREE food and it\u2019s completely up for grabs.\n\n\n\n The plant knowledge is no longer taught as it has been for thousands of generations before us. \n\n\n\n If we don\u2019t do something about it, this knowledge will be lost forever and one day we might pay the ultimate price for this.\n\n\n\n When you were growing up, it was probably your parents or grandparents that helped you identify your very first berry. \n\n\n\n This is something only YOU can pass down to your kids and grandkids as they don\u2019t learn these skills from TV, gadgets or school.\n\n\n\n",

International Publishers. #13116      \n \n   \"A spectre is haunting Europe,\" Karl Marx and Frederic Engels wrote in 1848, \"the spectre of Communism.\" This new edition of The Communist Manifesto, commemorating the 150th anniversary of its publication, includes an introduction by renowned historian Eric Hobsbawm which reminds us of the document's continued relevance. Marx and Engels's critique of capitalism and its deleterious effect on all aspects of life, from the increasing rift between the classes to the destruction of the nuclear family, has proven remarkably prescient. Their spectre, manifested in the Manifesto's vivid prose, continues to haunt the capitalist world, lingering as a ghostly apparition even after the collapse of those governments which claimed to be enacting its principles.

    "title": "THE BOOK OF ENOCH - Translated by  R. H Charles  (1917, London, Hardback)",
    "description": "The Book of EnochTranslated by R. H Charles  (1917, London), Compiled by Michael Heiser.  Hardback Book. 104 PagesThe Bible, as we hold it today, is esteemed by many religious institutions and especially Conservative Christians to be the inspired, inerrant Word of God. This doctrinal position affirms that the Bible is unlike all other books or collections of works in that it is free of error due to having been given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works? (2 Tim. 3:16, 17).\nWhile no other text can claim this same unique authority, the Book of Enoch is an ancient Jewish religious work, ascribed by tradition to Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah, which played a crucial role in forming the worldview of the authors of the New Testament, who were not only familiar with it but quoted it in the New Testament, Epistle of Jude, Jude 1:14-15, and is attributed there to \"Enoch the Seventh from Adam\" (1 En 60:8). The text was also utilized by the community that originally collected and studied the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nWhile some churches today include Enoch as part of the biblical canon (for example the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church), other Christian denominations and scholars accept it only as having historical or theological non-canonical interest and frequently use or assigned it as supplemental materials within academic settings to help students and scholars discover or better understand cultural and historical context of the early Christian Church. The Book of Enoch provides commentators valuable insight into what many ancient Jews and early Christians believed when, God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets? (Heb. 1:1).\n\nFOR COMMENTARY ON THE BOOK OF ENOCH, VISIT OUR EBAY STORE AT THE FOLLOWING LINKS:https://www.ebay.com/itm/313491908502?epid=19038554289&hash=item48fd92e796:g:9BwAAOSwHEhgdgkahttps://www.ebay.com/itm/313491906701?epid=19045621644&hash=item48fd92e08d:g:7DMAAOSwsNBgdgfh\n\nFOR TITLES BY MICHAEL HEISER AND TOM HORN, VISIT:https://www.ebay.com/str/impactchristianbooks/MICHAEL-HEISER/_i.html?_storecat=18367954015https://www.ebay.com/str/impactchristianbooks/TOM-HORN/_i.html?_storecat=19610006015\nFOR TITLES ON SPIRITUAL WARFARE, VISIT:https://www.ebay.com/str/impactchristianbooks/FRANK-HAMMOND/_i.html?_storecat=15631843015",

    "title": "American Marxism - by Mark R. Levin (SIGNED)",
    "description": "The six-time number one New York Times best-selling author, Fox News star, and radio host Mark R. Levin explains how the dangers he warned against in the \u201ctimely yet timeless\u201d (David Limbaugh, author of Jesus Is Risen) best seller Liberty and Tyranny have come to pass.In 2009, Mark R. Levin galvanized conservatives with his unforgettable manifesto Liberty and Tyranny, by providing a philosophical, historical, and practical framework for halting the liberal assault on Constitution-based values. That book was about standing at the precipice of progressivism\u2019s threat to our freedom, and now, over a decade later, we\u2019re fully over that precipice and paying the price.In American Marxism, Levin explains how the core elements of Marxist ideology are now pervasive in American society and culture - from our schools, the press, and corporations, to Hollywood, the Democratic Party, and the Biden presidency - and how it is often cloaked in deceptive labels like \u201cprogressivism\u201d, \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d, \u201csocial activism\u201d, and more. With his characteristic trenchant analysis, Levin digs into the psychology and tactics of these movements, the widespread brainwashing of students, the anti-American purposes of critical race theory and the Green New Deal, and the escalation of repression and censorship to silence opposing voices and enforce conformity. Levin exposes many of the institutions, intellectuals, scholars, and activists who are leading this revolution, and provides us with some answers and ideas on how to confront them.As Levin writes: \u201cThe counter-revolution to the American Revolution is in full force. And it can no longer be dismissed or ignored for it is devouring our society and culture, swirling around our everyday lives, and ubiquitous in our politics, schools, media, and entertainment.\u201d And, like before, Levin seeks to rally the American people to defend their liberty.",

I\u2019m talking about world wars, famines, riots, natural disasters\nand any other man-made crisis you can imagine. \nFull of protein, healthy fats and just the right amount of\ncarbs to keep you going these are the LOST FOODS that filled the pantries,\nlarders and the bellies of crisis survivors from the age of the Pharaohs all\nthe way up to the end of the Cold War.\nMost of these forgotten superfoods will keep good for a\nminimum of three years inside your pantry, without refrigeration. With some\nfoods it goes as high as sixty years. So, you can depend on them even if the\nGrid ever goes down or if some other disaster puts the lights out in your area\nfor an extended period of time.\nArt Rude, Claude Davis and Fred Dwight, the authors, have been\nstudying these lost foods in America for years and also kept in close contact\nwith other experts who\u2019ve done the same in other parts of the world. \nThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll find out with clear color pictures and precise\nstep-by-step instructions how to your own lost superfoods such as: \nThe US Doomsday Ration \u2013 a secret military superfood that\nwas developed during the Cold War and was meant to feed the entire US population\nin post-apocalyptic conditions.The Lost Ninja Superfood, that kept Japan\u2019s these elite\nwarriors well-fed on their month-long missions. \n\nAnd that\u2019s just the beginning! With more than 124 other\nlong-lost superfoods you\u2019ll have everything you need to remain well-fed and\nhealthy in the next crisis and help your family and loved ones do the same. ",
